globalwaves Player
==================

This is part of my radio project globalwaves (http://globalwaves.tk).
Though I created it out of a "competition" with Imposter and his Iris Radio, lol.

What is this?
-------------

This player allows you to connect to the globalwaves streaming server and listen
to the streams on them. Right now it is only the "Trance" stream, but by the end
of this week I will have added the following things:

- Switching between channels
- A nice GUI (I decided for a metro GUI now)
- Volume slider
- Nice audio visualizations (in progress right now)

Dependencies
------------

I'm relying on NAudio and Elysium.Theme to realize this player.
<code>bootstrap.bat</code> will automatically download all the needed files for you, so
that you don't need to manually install anything.

What to do before compiling/opening the project
-----------------------------------------------

1. Run <code>bootstrap.bat</code> and let it download the libraries.

Compiling without Visual Studio
-------------------------------

If you have .NET Framework 4.0/4.5 installed, but don't have Visual Studio,
you can also use <code>build.bat</code> to compile the project without it.
