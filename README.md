globalwaves Player
==================

This is part of my radio project globalwaves (http://globalwaves.tk).
Though I created it out of a "competition" with Imposter and his Iris Radio, lol.

What is this?
-------------

This player allows you to connect to the globalwaves streaming server and listen
to the streams on them. Right now it is only the "Trance" stream, but by the end
of this week I will have added the following things:

- Switching between channels
- A nice GUI
- Volume slider
- Nice audio visualizations

Dependencies
------------

I'm relying on NAudio and [future GUI library I will use here] to realize this
player.
You can get all things by installing NuGet into Visual Studio and let it do the
dirty work, it will automatically integrate NAudio and build all the needed
files.
